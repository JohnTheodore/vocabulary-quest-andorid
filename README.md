## Overview

This project is a WebView-based Android application designed to provide a seamless experience for Vocabulary Quest users on Android devices.

## Current Version: 0.2
* Initial release of the Vocabulary Quest Android wrapper.
* Implementation of the native Speech Synthesis bridge.
* Custom adaptive launcher icon and splash screen.
* Refactored and cleaned up codebase.
* Full-screen (Edge-to-Edge) implementation.

## Key Features

*   **Native Speech Synthesis Bridge:** Implements a custom `AndroidSpeechSynthesis` bridge that polyfills the web `speechSynthesis` API using native Android TTS, ensuring that lesson narrations work reliably.
*   **Audio Context Management:** Includes specialized logic to handle and resume `Howler.js` and Web Audio contexts, bypassing standard browser restrictions on autoplay audio.
*   **Desktop Experience:** Uses a custom Desktop User Agent to ensure the full Vocabulary Quest web interface is rendered correctly on tablet devices.
*   **Modern Android UI:** Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**, featuring full **Edge-to-Edge** support for an immersive learning environment.
*   **Performance Optimized:** Utilizes hardware acceleration and advanced WebView features like `DOCUMENT_START_SCRIPT` for early polyfill injection.
